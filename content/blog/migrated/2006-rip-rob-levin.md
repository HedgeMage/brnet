+++

Today, Rob Levin, aka lilo, CEO of PDPC and head of the Freenode IRC network, died of wounds sustained in a car-vs-bicycle accident a few days ago. He leaves behind his wife, Deborah, his son, Benjamin, and a legacy of cooperation, leadership, and tolerance. Rob will be missed by friends, family, and the FOSS community as a whole. You are not, and will not be, forgotten.
