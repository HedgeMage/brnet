> You can disagree without being disagreeable.
> -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg

The most disagreeable thing about social media is the behavior of the people on it.  The *behavior*, not the *people*.  This is a basic misunderstanding that has fueled a number of failed attempts to improve how large-scale internet communication works.

Right now, Twitter, Facebook, et al. are under a great deal of pressure to ban undesireables from their platforms.  The particulars of who is considered undesireable may vary based on the request, but the common theme is that we must only allow "the right people" into our communications networks, and that only ideological purity will protect us from the conflict, noise, and difficulty of getting things done which we currently endure.  If only those *bad people* were removed, people cry, it would all be better.

The internet is an incredibly diverse place, and that diversity is a *strength* we should be protecting.  Our incredibly interconnected world is being threatened by a Balkanization driven, in part, by this demand that *bad people* are kept out of various communications platforms.  We're losing the usefulness of our tools, and we're losing it because the strategy of finding and eliminating *bad people* is not working.

We'd get a lot further by targeting *bad behavior* without regard to the actor's beliefs, identity, or affiliation.  Clearly define civil behavior within the context of a venue, give some corrections as needed, and banhammer those who persist in uncivil behavior without regard to who they are or what they are being uncivil about.

# What is uncivil behavior?

> What is permissible is not always honorable.
> -- Marcus Tullius Cicero

We have freedom of speech here in my corner of the world, though there are those who would not have it so.  What a lot of people seem to miss is that "freedom of speech" means that one is free from prior restraint on one's speech by government, not that one's speech will be free of consequences.

Children often do things just because they *can*.  One mark of adulthood is stopping to ask whether one *should*.  Below are some real quotes that are representative of the tenor of social media today.  I've blacked out information that identifies individuals or specific ideologies: my focus is on the *behavior* of the individuals.

!["Oh God, why is my mother defending...There are days that I seriously regret being your son."](/content/images/2017/08/motherbashing.png)

This person decided to say something extremely hurtful to/about his mother in public, based on her holding a political opinion with which he disagrees.  I don't think she uses this platform, so she isn't even in a position to defend herself.






### Civility is a sign of strength, not weakness.

### Civility does not indicate an absence of conviction: just the opposite, it makes you more approachable to, and thus more likely to convince, individuals who disagree with you.

### Uncivil behavior costs you, and it costs everyone around you.
