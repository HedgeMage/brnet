There's a human contract that has shown up in a few places in my life...as a student working with some incredible martial arts and search-and-rescue trainers, as a teacher bringing self-defense and other skills to survivors of domestic violence, and in various ways in other relationships.  It's simple, but something not enough people experience any more:

*I want to do difficult and painful things, I want to grow, I want to change, and it's going to **suck**. I trust you to take me there.*

It's hard for me to identify with people who avoid pain as a matter of course.  I know they are the majority, and I can predict their behavior from my knowledge of psychology, but it's a headspace I can't put myself in.  If I realize something is hard, I look for a chance to pick at it, like a scab I just can't leave alone.  People with that compulsion grow very quickly when they find one another.

When I joined my first martial arts class, I was young and didn't know how tough I was.  I trained among the kinds of people who volunteer for experimental martial arts programs in addition to their regular Army duties.  I learned, from them, that an important part of training is stress inoculation[^1].  In my case, the guys knew I was extremely acrophobic[^2]. Consequently, my training involved some rounds of "climb this, then shoot or fight" to push my stress responses further.  My guys were evil sometimes messing with me, and I loved them for it.  

Some years later, I decided I was done with acrophobia.  I chose to spend ten days in Colorado with a friend--and more experienced mountaineer--bagging peaks.

It's the same thing when a child says "I'll do it if you hold my hand".


[^1]: The martial arts definition of "stress inoculation" isn't too different from the psych term: it means, roughly, training skills and behaviors under manufactured stress in order to be more prepared for actually-stressful situations.

[^2]: "acrophobic" means "afraid of heights"
