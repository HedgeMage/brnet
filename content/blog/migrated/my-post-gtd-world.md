If you're a planning and productivity nerd at all, you're familiar with GTD, or "[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)", the book and methodology by David Allen.  It hearkens back to countless things that came before with some simple truths:

1. You'll be more productive if you aren't wasting brainpower trying to remember your to-do list, or that appointment with your dentist three weeks from now.
2. In order to avoid spending mental resources on remembering, you must have a system that you trust so fully that you no longer feel obligated to remember.
3. When you are systematically recording your intentions and your actions, you now have tools to think more critically about what you are doing and why, where your time is going, and how to optimize these and other factors.

I still agree with all of these concepts.  However, as my work shifted from predominantly individual contributor roles (which, in infosec, can be a lot like firefighting) to predominantly leadership roles, the GTD-esque workflow I'd relied on became a poor fit.  GTD centers tightly around recording and executing tasks, taking in communications and putting out communications or products.  My world isn't so neat any more.

Some of my most important duties are *thinking*, *strategizing*, *developing people*, and *developing processes*.  These and many other endeavors don't fit neatly into a GTD-structured world.  At least for me, focusing too much on appointments, tasks, incoming demands, and outputting products exacerbated my already incredible tendency[^1] to get stuck in firefighting mode.

## I needed to see the whole field.

As an Information Security Officer, as a manager, as ICEI's president, and as a member of my work unit's leadership team, I can't just focus on the task at hand.  Yes, there will be incidents from time to time which require laser beam focus...for a while.  However, I need to shift my day-to-day thinking toward a longer view.  I'm pretty good at seeing the whole picture when I encounter something novel, or in focused bursts when trying to find a creative solution to a specific problem, but less good at maintaining that big-picture view when operating in a well-known environment, and I haven't yet defined or identified a problem.

## I liked the tools that I had.

While I started this project completely certain that I would need new process, I was fairly attached to my stand-by tools: a leather cover holding an agenda book and a Leuchtturm1917 hardcover I use as my [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/), with one of my favorite fountain pens attached.  I'd tried a number of digital systems and paper planners but they were all too restrictive for me.  *I needed a process that changed the content I captured with the tools I had.*

## This was the latest stage in a long evolution.

It's important to note, before I lay out my system as I use it today, that I do not recommend that anyone start here.  This system is how I am dealing with the latest stage in a decades-long evolution.

I bought my first day planner, an A5-sized Day Timer ring binder, two pages per day format, when I was in the sixth grade.  I think even my mom thought it a bit weird, but she went along.  By that time, in addition to my schoolwork, I was actively tutoring several special needs students, volunteering as a "junior leader" for two programs at a local counseling center, taking catechism classes at my parents' church, helping to run a mentally handicapped aunt's household logistics, doing my share of the work on my grandparents' farm, singing in the school choir, playing on the school volleyball team, and beginning to volunteer with open source software projects online.  In short, I was one busy kid.

Back then, it was all about making sure I didn't drop any balls.  It was all tasks and due dates and phone numbers and what time I needed to be where and how I would get a ride.  To do lists, schedules, and little facts I needed to keep safe all lived in my planner.

I went through a few planners in a few slightly different formats over the next decade, but it wasn't until my early twenties, when working on my first book and trying to save a troubled IRC network, that the process changed.  For the first time, I needed to routinely share some things in my planner with others.  I moved to a bigger binder that separated my personal to-do items and schedule from meeting notes, writing notes, and technical things.  This allowed me to scan pages I needed to share with others, or transcribe them by hand if needed.  Regardless of the method, getting notes into others' hands meant keeping relevant collections *together*.

At 29, I discovered BulletJournaling, and I loved how fast and free-form it was.  I was already feeling the pressure that more rigid systems added to my day, and the weight of the wasted paper I ended up carrying with me.  I loved the implicit context given to my note-taking and thinking collections on a subject by where they appeared amid my dailies.  I wouldn't recommend that most people brand new to personal organization and planning start with a BuJo, though: that freeform system worked well for me because I already knew, from my previous experience:
* What to record, and what not to, about each day
* How to capture meetings in real time
* How to brainstorm on paper
* How to pick a structure from a hat and jump-start myself when I was stuck staring at a blank page
* How to realistically break up my time, and how to realistically plan to spend it
* How to break down projects into subtasks
* The implied tasks (communication, archival, etc.) that came with my "real" tasks

More structured planners can be a valuable cheat sheet for these and other things: I'm glad I had them early in my self-management education.

Over the past six years, my BuJo has evolved a bit.  I added a slim weekly agenda to capture meetings and appointments, and ditched the BuJo monthly spread.  I made up a few [signifiers](https://bulletjournal.com/get-started/#signifiers) to suit my purposes.  I never got into decorative spreads the way so many people do: I wanted fast, readable, and useful...not art.  However, those bullets still let me be very task-focused.  Things in, things out, check off the to-do list.  It was good, but not enough for my next evolution.

## So what's this latest stage?

The state I found myself in was one where I'd mastered a number of things to the point that I could do them on the fly.  I had ingrained habits, carefully cultivated over the years, for information intake, breaking down tasks, managing the day-to-day of project communication, and so on.

I was struggling with effective reporting, and with maintaining focus in meetings where others were disorganized, where some information was not relevant to me, or where I found my brain jumping ahead of the conversation.  Most importantly, I was struggling with how to keep my eyes on the big picture:

* Was Project A on track to meet its annual goals?
* How well did I understand my new direct report's capabilities, and what could I do to understand better?
* How could I mature the information security program for Project B?
* When Organization C had a new PM slot open up, should I first offer it to Alice or to Bob, or look for an outside recruit?
* When I appear before the Board for Organization D, what do I have to report? Is there something else I should be tracking in order to make reporting better or easier?
* How could Organization E better relate its offerings to outside stakeholders and potential consumers?

**None of these questions would be answered by a to-do list.**

Meanwhile, I still had stuff to do, and things that I didn't want to be late for.  I also had to regularly re-orient myself and re-prioritize after something new shook up my work.  (Such is life in infosec.)


## What am I doing about it?

I started by collecting some journals and planners to look at that took approaches other than the to-do-list-centric one.  Most of them were terrible from a productivity standpoint.  Two had useful aspects I could learn from.  My biggest breakthrough came from a discussion on [Dave Sheah](https://davidseah.com/)'s virtual coworking chat.  Dave and I, among others, began to talk about the downfalls of being ruled by a to-do list.
