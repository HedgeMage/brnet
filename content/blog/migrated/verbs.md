I recently had an interesting conversation about how a person who specifically enjoys people of differing backgrounds, viewpoints, and endeavors chooses affinity groups, and how one knows what groups *not* to be part of.  It resulted in the following observation, which I'd never before put into words:

> People and groups that self-define with verbs interest me a great deal more than those that self-define with nouns and adjectives.

It's a subtle difference to most people.  Our popular culture spends a lot of time talking about sex, race, urban vs. rural, levels of education, and socio-economic strata.  None of these is predictive of who I'll spend my time with, though.

Similarly, groups around *being a...something* are draining for me, even when I fit the target demographic.  These groups fall quickly to what's alternately called the "tyranny of" or "narcissism of" [small differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences).  With no unifying mission, they tend to obsess over defining the in and out groups.

# Shared mission is a unifying force.

Over the years, I've worked with and bonded with people extremely different from myself due to sharing a mission or purpose with them.  There's no purity test to pass: we're just here to further the mission, so if you further the mission, you're in.  It shortcuts a lot of human status jockeying (though, by no means all).

Additionally, shared mission incentivises *change* and *human development*.  With groups based on shared identity, there's a need not to stray too much from the norms.  Alternatively, groups based on shared mission tend to push individuals to change and grow, rather than penalizing it.  Outstanding members can be rewarded instead of becoming targets of suspicion, because they aren't setting a bar that others must live up to or risk expulsion.

# Shared activities are good, too.

There needn't be a mission with an end goal for a group to bond.  Often, shared activities (i.e. *doing*, not *liking* or *consuming*...active endeavors) can do the job.  Whether it's a love of painting or kayaking, building treehouses or
