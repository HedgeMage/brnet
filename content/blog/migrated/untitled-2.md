In case you're ever unsure of how to ruin an information security professional's day, here's a tip: ask her to submit her driver's license and other sensitive documents via unencrypted email.  I promise you'll succeed.

## How I started tilting and windmills (this time):

As it turned out, nobody was phishing me.  A perfectly reasonable member of an organization's administrative staff was trying to get her job done after the SSL-secured portal where I'd already uploaded the relevant documents broke.  Her manager, whom I contacted, simply shrugged and told me that he was not aware of any policy he'd broken.  They genuinely didn't seem to understand why I wanted this practice to stop even though I'd already made alternate arrangements for my documents.

Here's how I explained it when I went over his head, seeking someone who could and would help:

> We increasingly live in a world of Haves and Have-Nots when it comes to protection from cybercrime.  People like me who work with technology for a living are relatively safe.  The elementary school teacher and the repairman, the truck driver and the farmer, are increasingly unsafe, because they have less knowledge, less money, and less leverage with which to protect themselves not just against the bad guys, but against negligent organizations that put them at risk simply because nobody in the organization really owns the problem and has to fix it.

*If you learn nothing else from me about infosec, learn this:* **if it might be somebody else's problem, or it isn't clear who has the authority, it usually won't get fixed.**

You might wonder why 36 hours and half a blog post later, I still care about the clerk who asked me to email documents that should be sent securely.  What I didn't mention before is that it was a law enforcement office making the request.

Law enforcement is asked for their involvement more and more in cybercrime incidents these days, and many in this line of work are in no small hurry to give their opinions on the matter.  Ordinary people think they are experts.   So, when the police make a request like this, those same trusting, ordinary people think it is safe.

*This is how identity theft happens.*  Our non-expert clerk and her boss have now convinced a bunch of random citizens that it is safe to email identity documents.  Even if not a single document from these police requests is stolen, the police are training people to be more susceptible to phishing attacks.

## I annoyed a bunch of people about this.

For the most part, I felt indignant.  It's a not-on-my-watch sort of grumpiness of which only sheepdog personalities and compulsive fixers know the true depths (I'm both).  I called the clerk's office and spoke to one of her equally perplexed coworkers, then I tried their boss.  Next, I got hold of someone in office whom I thought might be positioned to help.  That person did get back to me with a promise to look into things, which is why I'm not naming and shaming yet.

Meanwhile, my husband, my son, several coworkers, and my parents have had to hear me vent about it.

## Here's the part that really got to me...

Most of the people I vented to just shrugged it off and voiced their expectation that anyone affiliated with government is bound to be both incompetent and unwilling to take responsibility to the point of recklessness, especially when it comes to anything technical or anything that only has direct consequences for random citizens.  I'm extremely cynical and tend toward the minarchist side: I'd happily fire more than half of government workers and redefine more than half the functions of government out of existance were it at my whim to do so[^2].

None of those people seemed to think that their low expectations got us here.

I've seen what low expectations do to organizations as small as companies or even PTOs and as large as governments.  When I go home, I know people who just don't believe that I don't know of any past or current Governor of my new home state having embezzled from the taxpayers.  In Illinois, some fraction of people have just come to see that as normal.  I think IL has had 5 or so Governors imprisoned for corruption in recent memory.

I've seen what low expectations does in schools.  Same place: my hometown, just south of Chicago.  It's not a well-off place, but they are proud of their school which is not as bad as Chicago Public Schools despite being smaller and less resourced.  People genuinely trying to improve the school have been pushed back by demands that they not try too hard or reach too high.  Getting that school to where schools in my current town are isn't even considered.

I don't think the clerks who were just trying to get through a process with probably little or no training are to blame here.  However, I'm quite disappointed in their manager, who saw no reason to consider my explanation and warning.  He made it clear that it was about the rules: if he was meeting expectations, he was happy, no matter how low those expectations were.  He didn't see a problem and start looking for ways to improve just because he could improve something and cause some citizens to be at less risk.
