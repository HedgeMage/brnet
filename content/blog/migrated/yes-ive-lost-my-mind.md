I've been thinking about it in an offhand, "Oh, I'd never have time" sort of way for a couple of years. This year, thanks to my good friend Steve, I'm doing it.

[NaNoWriMo: National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org)
For 30 days, I'm taking a break from my various volunteer opportunities, from playing online chess while my son naps, and from spending all of my time trying to be productive. I'm going to write a novel, and, for once in my life, not care if it's perfect. I'm excited, and apprehensive. I suppose now that I've emailed my mom to tell her about NaNoWriMo and encourage her to mention the NaNoWriMo Young Writers Program to teachers at her school, promised Steve I'd be his partner in crime, and blogged about it, I have to do it. That is the scary part. That's also why I'm blogging about it -- so I have to do it. 30 days... 50,000 words... caffeine and chocolate without measure... no excuses. NaNoWriMo.
