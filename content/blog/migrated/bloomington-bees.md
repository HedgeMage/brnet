My 14yo son, Lucas[^1], is working on his first startup.  [Bloomington Bees](https://bloomingtonbees.com) is a Bloomington, Indiana based apiary, or bee farm, producing honey, beeswax, honeycomb, and other interesting things.  The Bloomington Bees blog, linked above, launched last week and received a bit of polish today making it ready to promote.  Lucas talks about beekeeping and what it is like to start a business while still in school.

My original post about Lucas's beekeeping endeavor can be found here: [So it bee-gins.](/2017/06/11/so-it-bee-gins)
