I'm a fan of going analog whenever I can manage.  Fountain pens and paper are a great way to focus, and to stay organized without waiting on apps or relying on batteries.  I've used and iterated on my trusty [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com) for some time now.  However, as I've gotten busier I've started missing the pre-printed calendars from when I used to use more structured planners.  Not willing to give up the freedom of big note taking spreads and rapid logging, I set out to find a hybrid solution.

Now I can have my cake and eat it, too with a leather cover that holds both my Leuchtturm1917 harcover A5 Bullet Journal and a softcover A5 notebook of my choice.  Right now there's a navy blue Moleskine notebook in there, but I plan to replace it with a softcover calendar.

Where did I find such a thing, you might ask?  I couldn't.  I perused Amazon and Etsy, checked some local shops, and to no avail.  So, not to be deterred (and with my saddle stitching skills firmly rusted to uselessness), I looked for someone who would take a custom order.  [D&M Leather Studio](http://amzn.to/2fnz7HB), selling through Amazon, had [something close to what I wanted](http://amzn.to/2fnXjKb) in their store.  I found their customer service rep very helpful as we talked about my desired modifications, namely:

- sizing the inside pocket to accommodate a second notebook
- changing the snap closure to a leather tie (this is quieter, so I won't feel like I'm bothering people when I open and close my notebook in a meeting, library, or coffee shop)
- Making the pen loop larger, to accommodate my penchant for chunky fountain pens (TWSBI Eco pictured)

I was like a kid at Christmas waiting for the final product to arrive from China, but it came today[^1]!  The quality is excellent.  Were I to do it again, the only changes I would make would be to ask that the outside corners be rounded (I may do that myself as an aftermarket mod) and to widen the leather strap closure just a bit.

[^1]: The wait was two days longer than planned due to a mistake by DHL, the shipping company.  D&M did a great job of resolving this.
