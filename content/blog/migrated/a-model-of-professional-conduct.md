It sounds like a stodgy concept, but professional conduct is a cultural meme that offers an incredible force multiplier for work that requires collaboration by strong minds.

## What Professional Conduct Is
For the purpose of this writing, "professional conduct" refers to a functional set of social norms with the following characteristics:

* **Differentiated Responsibility**: This is the single most important aspect of professional conduct: leaders and managers are more responsible and must live up to a higher standard than followers and inexperienced, low-ranking individuals.  Leaders and managers put the interests of the organization and of those below them before their own interests.
* **Specificity of Mission**: Professional conduct applies to contexts where a team or organization has come together in order to further a stated mission, as opposed to things that happen for personal enjoyment.
* **Purpose Before Personality**: The mission is held by all to be sufficiently important that we adopt a system of behavior which allows us to work effectively with people whom we may not like personally or wish to befriend.  The purpose of a team or organization is to maximize effectiveness relative to a specific mission, *not* to provide personal validation to all members.
* **Clarity of Communication**: Clear expectations and predictable, regular communication create trust and reliability in an organization.
* **Outcome Focused**: Professional conduct has no room for self-indulgence, offense-taking, or self-righteousness; it is designed to incentivize the right *outcomes* for a team or organization.


## What Professional Conduct Is Not

* Professional conduct **does not ensure that individuals are comfortable or personally validated**.
* Professional conduct **has no bearing on what happens outside of the professional context**, and it **is not a way to dictate who a person is or what they may believe**.  This concept is entirely about one's behavior in a professional setting.
* Professional conduct **does not reward individuals for choosing to take offense**.
* Professional conduct **does not reward escalation of interpersonal conflict**.
* Professional conduct **is not about ensuring that all players share the "right" ideology or mindset**.
* Professional conduct **does not mean that mistakes in behavior cannot be forgiven** or that all interactions must be formal and/or rigid.


## Understanding the Benefits
There is discipline involved in this.  That discipline is well-rewarded in what our teams accomplish, in getting to work without interpersonal drama, in the long-haul growth of individuals and the resulting collective growth of a team or organization.  In other words: this is how you get what all those Codes of Conduct promised you, but never delivered.

### Don't be fooled into thinking you can buy your way out.

Many in the computing fields believe that by "hiring only 'A' players", they can avoid the need for established behavioral memes.  However, with millions of programmers working around the world today, we cannot count on every single one being better than average, let alone a top 5% performer.

The [Skunk Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works) relied on recruiting top performers in aerospace. However, they could not have succeeded if they hadn't the whole body of Lockheed from which to recruit. Lockheed hired a variety of people and provided opportunities for personal growth and professional development, letting the cream rise to the top.  Some of that cream became Lockheed leadership, and some of it migrated to the Skunk Works.  Within the computing industry, only those willing to behave like Lockheed can hope to have a Skunk Works.

### Why now?

It may seem like this is something that would never have made an article fifty years ago, because it would not have.  Fifty years ago, very few individuals worked regularly with people from far away regions, let alone distant countries and cultures.  Nor did the computing industry have the high pressure position it today occupies.  The power inherent in ubiquitous technology combined with the money involved have given us the combined dysfunctions of the worst eras of the finance industries and social services: pressures which did not exist when computing was still obscure.  Moreover, fifty years ago, at least here in the U.S., there was a much stronger division between one's professional and private lives.  The internet has driven people to try and advertise their every belief, affiliation, identity marker, and 



## How is professional conduct practiced?







# Boneyard

Many of the engineers and researchers around me insist that we can merely fill out our teams with the right people--"rock stars" and "A players" who are so culturally compatible that they never conflict--and get great results without management or the overhead of learning to behave a certain way in professional environments.

This once worked (for those who pulled it off), and many in our fields expect it to continue working.  However, the environment in which we are operating has changed significantly since the middle half of the twentieth century, when these expectations were established.

## Is working today really so different?

When the social norms around "just hire A players" were established, the computational sciences were just that: a specialized and esoteric science.  Teams were small and few, and had a number of feeder environments from which to draw the top players.  Now, computing is ubiquitous, but most teams still presume to hire only top players.  90% of teams cannot hire the top 5% of talent: the numbers simply don't work out, even allowing for differing definitions of "top talent".

Additionally, we no longer have the "feeder" tracks that once existed for engineers and researchers.  


Academia is, as a whole, not providing what we need.  The focus of our supposed feeder disciplines has become more theoretical and mechanical--lost in syntax and algorithms--and less comprehensive or practice-based.  Meanwhile, the surrounding culture has changed.  It was once a given that one worked with people living in their general vicinity, and left one's personal life at the door.  However, today teams often span regions or even continents, and endless social media experiences have taught people to put feelings and identity on their sleeves while demanding that the world not cause them to feel offense.

As if that were not enough, there is  alack of professional development being provided throughout most of our industry.  New recruits are not being taught how to separate their work from their personal lives, and leadership is not being taught about differentiated responsibility or the importance of establishing a culture that *grows* people.

Finally, the preference for flatter organizations with less hierarchy often means that A players come up the ranks without fully understanding their influence and responsibilities.  Thus, they often cannot be combined: an organization must sequester them into separate fiefdoms to keep these needed high performers from fighting constantly and tearing down one another's work.  The lack understanding around influence and responsibilities often leads to senior personnel behaving destructively toward junior personnel.

## This is the situation we are in:



Currently, most "diversity" efforts in the tech industry are extremely focused on a window-dressing, statistical approach to diversity.  The emphasis is on including more people whose appearances and identities violate perceived norms.  However, this has not effectively given us heterodoxy, or ideological diversity, nor has it produced a diversity in thinking and strategic approaches.  This is because my high school friend, a black banker's son, was a great deal more like a white banker's son than he was like a black ghetto kid or a black farmhand.  All we've done is hire bankers' kids of differing profiles.

A culture with a strong current of professional conduct enables true diversity: people with truly divergent beliefs and cultures can work together functionally, and their vastly different thinking patterns contribute to every strategic initiative undertaken by the group.
