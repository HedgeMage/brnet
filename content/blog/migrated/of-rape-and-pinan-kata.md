+++

I spent most of last night's karate class working on the first three of a series we call the "Pinan", or "Peaceful Mind" Kata[^1].  One of our black belts told the class that while "Peaceful Mind" may refer to the kind of moving meditation a kata becomes once one has been doing it long enough, it is also said that once one has mastered all five of the Pinan kata, one can walk the streets of the city with a peaceful mind, knowing that one can deal with any self-defense situation likely to arise.

There's [a blog post](http://glosswatch.com/2012/07/27/its-not-victim-blaming-just-common-sense/) making the rounds on G+ that compares the suggestion that women take any steps to protect themselves from rape to the demand that men should abstain from all sexual conduct in order to avoid the possibility of a false rape accusation.  Setting aside for a moment the many other problems with this comparison, I am continually stunned by the premises core to the "you're blaming the victim" thesis: that suggesting someone protect him- or herself is placing some unjustly freedom-limiting onus on that person, and that rapists can and should be trusted to stop rape from happening.

I can't say that I've *mastered* any of the Pinan kata yet, though I have the first three committed to memory.  Shorei Goju-Ryu karate is not my first martial art, and I have successfully defended myself and others in the past.  My safety comes from me, it doesn't rely on other people doing the right thing, and *that* gives me peace of mind.  I cannot imagine anything more freeing than knowing that I can effectively assess the risks of a particular situation, make good judgments, and defend myself or others if it becomes necessary to do so.

Of course, having some ability to protect myself and loved ones from violence isn't the only thing that gives me peace of mind.  Being a decent hand at emergency medicine, wilderness and urban survival, automotive repair, field engineering, and dealing with weather disasters means that I don't spend a ton of time worrying about the world around me.  The thing is, all of those competencies are less controversial than my competency at dealing with person-on-person violence.  Nobody vilifies me when I encourage others to prepare for tornadoes, blizzards, or medical emergencies.  Nobody thinks that advocating preparation is equal to blaming the person hurt by the tornado or trapped in the blizzard for the tornado or the blizzard happening, or cries about the unfairness of asking mere mortals to take action in pursuit of self-preservation.

**Why is rape different?**

While I think Grossman may have overstated it when he called interpersonal violence "the universal human phobia"[^3], he was definitely on to something.  The vast majority of people I see react with more irrational fear toward interpersonal violence than toward weather emergencies, car accidents, or even cancer.  We have no problem saying "blizzards happen" or "tornadoes happen" but many segments of first-world society consider it natural to assume that interpersonal violence will not happen.  More accurately, it is so natural to assume this that they have not considered it at all. 

People from that sort of background often express to me the assumption that studying and being prepared means I live in fear.  For the sheepdog[^2], violence is a lot like a blizzard: we try to see them coming, avoid them when possible, deal with them when we have to, and knowing that we are capable of all those things we are not afraid of violence any more than you are afraid of blizzards.

Everyone knows that blizzards happen, but a lot of people work very hard to pretend that rape doesn't, or at least that it can't happen to *them*.  It feels safer to see violence as a distant theoretical abstract, to talk about cultural changes that might, in a few generations, reduce the impetus to rape in some people, to insist that the just application of violence is the purview of police, not citizens...until one finds oneself alone with an individual bent on committing rape.

Unfortunately, when that moment happens, the time to prepare has passed.  It is too late to learn how to fail a victim interview, too late to learn situational awareness, too late to decide not to compromise oneself with drugs or alcohol, too late to learn how to establish personal boundaries, and too late to train in self-defense.  Two people are there: one rapist, and one intended victim.  The rapist wants rape to happen, and has brought the tools and mindset to bring about that outcome.  The *only* chance of an outcome other than rape are the tools and mindset of the only non-rapist present: the intended victim.

It's no more fair than getting stuck in your car in a blizzard and freezing to death.  Yet, while it's acceptable to tell people to put blankets and chemical warmers in their car along with flares and a red flag to mark the car in an emergency, our society comes down like a ton of bricks on anyone so disobedient as to suggest that one learn to avoid, rebuff, and if necessary physically stop a rapist.

Sadly, most people, even when convinced that being able to defend oneself is useful and non-evil, won't act on that conviction.  Some just don't act on their beliefs in general, and those I cannot help.  However, many procrastinate because they grossly overestimate the amount of time, money, and effort involved in basic self-protection.

I am a martial artist--now--but I avoided or dispatched dozens of threats (that I know of) before training in martial arts.  I grew up in what my present-day peers would call a rough area, though I can't remember feeling unsafe growing up there.  The threat of human violence *existing* was just part of life, as much as tornadoes, feral dog packs,

[^1]: A kata is a prearranged form in karate -- a sequence of prescribed movements that we practice over and over in order to learn some skill.  Even if you are not a martial artist, you may be familiar with the general idea, as movie directors seem to really like shots of their martial-arts-practicing characters repeating these sequences in the middle of some stunning landscape or other.
