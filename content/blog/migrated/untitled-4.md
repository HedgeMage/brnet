I'm sitting in a grant writing workshop sponsored by my workplace, in the wake of some minor drama in an unrlated organization, and my thoughts have turned to how various individuals think about money.

The environment I grew up in was all about work.  My parents were amazing providers, despite our being tied by family and history to an insular community with a failed economy.  We worked the land (the land was beautiful).  My parents both had demanding blue-collar jobs.  We cared for aging family members.  I started working in my pre-teens, and by high school was juggling three part-time jobs.  My mother took a second job (or was it a third?) at that point to help keep me in school.

## Work was about money, and money was about survival.

Some of my best business was done under survival pressure.  It wasn't the work I cared about the most: but it was an accomplishment in its own right.  In the summer of 2007, I was a software engineer with no head for business who'd spent the last 1.5 years as a stay-at-home mom thanks to family needs.  However, a sudden divorce that left me penniless and over 2,000 miles from any family support was startling motivation.  With no degree, having been out of the work force for over a year, living in a region replete with dot-bomb burnouts, I wasn't very employable.  Within 30 days, I'd started a business in a fast-growing area of software development that I'd never planned to work in, and made enough profit to move my child and I back to my home town.

Now, ten years later, I have experience under my belt in myriad types of start-ups, and a stable career in the fields I really care about: infrastructure software engineering and information security.  However, having become stable, my motivation isn't survival: it's quality-of-life and funding the things I want to be doing.  However, it took me two survival crises followed by growth and stability to get here.

## People who never did the survival stage seem to look at things differently.

For many people, this will never matter.  Many people go into a fairly stable career without much in the way of financial autonomy, and as long as they are pretty good at it and decent people, they will make enough to get by.  Their lives will be good.  They can focus on things that matter more to them than money.

However, if yours is a non-traditional career path, or if you are trying to sustain an organization or make something specific happen... then you need to think critically abouth the economics involved in order to be effective.  Still, I meet many people engaged in these types of endeavors who don't understand, and continue to look down on, anything classed as business skills.  I get it: it took me some survival scenarios in order to not think like this.
