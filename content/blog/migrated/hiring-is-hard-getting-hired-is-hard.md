The hardest thing to do is not something you do every day, but something you do just seldomly enough to not get natural practice.  It's worse when that thing is as important as hiring: when it can determine your family's financial stability and your happiness, or when it can determine your team's harmony and success.

I won't claim to know all about hiring or getting hired.  I've been a freelancer or consultant for more than half my career, so I got to skip that bit in exchange for a different type of selling myself.  However, as we just wound up a round of interviewing at my current workplace, and I'm planning to send someone an offer, I've been thinking of things I've seen over the years and thought I'd get my observations down before I forget them.

## It's not obvious that there are good ways to go about it.

As a consultant, I'd had the job of sitting in as a subject-matter expert from time to time, when a company I'd contracted for was hiring a maintenance team to take over whatever I'd helped them build or fix.  This gave me a very bad impression of hiring processes in general.

At one extreme, some companies' HR departments had so constrained the hiring managers that the hiring managers felt powerless to really improve their teams.  Often, the hiring managers found out that HR had tweaked job descriptions before posting the listing, in ways that were completely nonsensical for the technologies involved.  This, it turns out, is why many companies are out there looking for 10 years experience in a technology that was invented four years ago.  In exchange for this very ineffective process, both hiring managers and potential hires were subjected to incredibly Byzantine processes that chased off the best, least-desperate candidates...for reasons no one could state clearly.

Others failed at the other extreme: they had no process.  The hiring manager was awash at sea, and tended to do this or that thing which sounded trendy in an article recently.  Or they winged it.  Interview quality varied, depending on the hiring manager's base talent for this sort of thing.  The process was never written down and iterated on.  The quality of incoming employees varied just as wildly, from utter disaster to amazing find.  Interview processes included every blasted thing from logic puzzles to coding live with an interviewer breathing down one's neck to inappropriately personal questions and, once, a trip to a bowling alley with the team.

Both types of organization felt that they were doing not necessarily the best thing, but the only thing that could be done.

## There Is Method To the Madness

My current workplace has been working hard to develop a repeatably-good process for hiring.  We've had some amazing hires, and almost no truly bad ones.
