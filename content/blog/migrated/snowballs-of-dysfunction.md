There's a pattern that has existed probably as long as humans have, but which is greatly amplified by modern communication tools such as the internet...a pattern that just makes me sad.  I don't know that it has a name, but in my head I've started calling it "the dysfunctional snowball".

Everyone has some amount of dysfunctions.  The particular variety and severity will vary greatly from person to person, but nobody's perfect.  Healthy people find ways to overcome their particular challenges, or to collaborate with others who differ from them, so that they have the opportunity to play to their strengths.  Healthy people choose situations that enable, or even force, them to grow and overcome.

However, there's a very comfortable-feeling but unhealthy pattern that seems especially powerful in the lives of so many people lately.  A dysfunctional snowball happens when a group of people with the same dysfunction find one another, and instead of coaching and supporting one another in overcoming the challenges they are all familiar with, they form a group identity based on that problem or dysfunction.  At this point, anything that could actually help any of these individuals threatens their feeling of belonging, and even their sense of identity.

The group begins to extol the virtues of whatever they have formed around, and other those who don't share or who have overcome whatever this central dysfunction is.  They reinforce one another's bad behavior and thought patterns.
