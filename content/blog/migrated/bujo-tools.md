My personal organization system has been in a state of slow evolution since I bought my first planner binder at age 9.  I'd just begun volunteering at a local counseling center, which was a departure from the more regimented activities typical of middle school.  Piano lessons, volleyball, choir, and so on were matters of showing up on time and practicing between lessons.  I now had a situation where I had different things to track: meetings, upcoming event dates, content I was trying to write and other projects to finish.  Plus, I was taking in a lot more information.

Some database in a direct-marketing company somehow got my name and address, and I received a Day Timer catalog in the mail, with a trial offer, which I promptly filled out and sent back.  I don't think my mother appreciated me ordering something I'd later be billed for without checking with her; but I announced that I had the money in my savings account in case I decided to keep it, and I'd just assumed she'd take the money and write a check on my behalf.  In 1991, $60 was a ton of money for a nine-year-old, even one who took every babysitting job she could put her hands on, but my parents (thankfully) tended to take the idea that they'd rather me make financial mistakes when I was small, and let me at it.

I ended up with a hefty little black binder
