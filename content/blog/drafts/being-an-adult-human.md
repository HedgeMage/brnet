There's a phenomenon to which I've lost several good communities in recent years.  It happens when there's a community of practice[^1] fails to maintain its integrity as it grows, shifting from being a context for personal growth to a sort of toxic protectionist racket for those who refuse to grow.  I'm trying to document the phenomenon here, for my own reflection and to try to figure out how to sustain communities of practice rather than letting them devolve in this way.

# Communities of Practice

We need communities of practice.  This isn't to say nothing else can exist: a club for, e.g. appreciating paintings or watching anime, isn't a *bad* thing.  It's just not a high-growth activity.  Consumption doesn't challenge people the ways that actively doing something can.  Without communities of practice, those who want to move from where they are to something better must do so in isolation.

It doesn't really matter what "better" means in this discussion.  What I'm observing applies equally to:

- People trying to get out of bad personal patterns, have a healthier social life and better mental health

- People trying to get in shape

- People trying to master a craft

- People trying to cure a disease

- A team trying to become best in their sports league

- A group of volunteer search-and-rescue trying to maintain and grow their capabilities

- A group of people trying to advance in their professions, or perhaps advance a profession

I could give more examples than I'd know what to do with.  The point is, that if one wants to be *better*, one must have regular contact with others who are on the same trajectory.  Members of a community of practice learn from one another, encourage one another, and provide relief from the company of those who ride on passively through life, passengers, not interested in chosing a direction and driving.

# Trajectory Matters

It's important to note that communities of practice can and should be welcome to people at different levels of development: 



[^1]: For this context, I'm defining "community of practice" as *a group devoted to the furthering of a common goal or a practice or profession*.

A healthy community of practice has the following features:

- It is organized around *doing something* rather than *being something*.  This is extremely important: identity-based groups eventually fall to the [narcissism of small differences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences), whereas action-based groups get to rally around a common goal.
 - The group's mission is held to take precedence over other concerns, for the context of activities within the group.  So, for example, one may find members of opposing religions or political factions working together within the group, even though they don't socialize outside and may object to the other's outside activities.

- It encourages a steady stream of new people and ideas to join.

I've recently left yet another community because the leadership, driven by the broader community, have decided that we need to--in a venue with heavy drinking, adult content, and martial arts content--not only accommodate people who lack a basic adult ability to interact with others safely, but place the burden of their dysfunction on anyone who they take issue with, after the fact.

This is a pretty common theme today: to create so-called "safe spaces" by declaring that self-care, let alone courtesy or care toward others, is the burden of some groups but not others.  It came

- People who have eschewed self-improvement are not only accepted, but supported, in doing so.
