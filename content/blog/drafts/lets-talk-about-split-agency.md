This is going to be a long one, so have a seat with your favorite beverage.  I'll wait...

You're probably not familiar with the term "split agency" in the context of human behavior and motivation.  It's apparently so obscure that neither dict.org nor Google would cough up a reference for me.  I learned about split agency as a child, volunteering at a psych center near my home.  Much of what I learned could be deemed "lessons in how things go horribly wrong", and I'm about to teach you a very, very important one.

**Split agency** is a situation in which the person with primary control over how something is done and with what resources is *not* the person with the greatest and most immediate responsibility or reward for related outcomes.

***If you dig deeply enough into many human problems, you will find split agency at the root.***


## Split agency is demoralizing.

Imagine being the well-behaved kid who's not really liked enough to shape anyone else's behavior in a class that is punished as a class for bad behavior.  Imagine having a boss who micromanages how you do your work, forcing you to go through a braindead and inefficient process, but then reprimands you when the product is behind schedule and not as high-quality as desired.  Imagine working long days and really rallying a team to implement a solution you came up with to a problem no one thought was solvable, only to have all credit go to someone who wasn't even on the team.  These are just a few of examples of what split agency looks like.

Whether you get the control without the recognition, or the recognition without the control, having no connection between your actions and how you are viewed as a person and a professional eats away at a person.  It's why even the most mentally healthy person cannot stay healthy and stable while living with an unstable partner who lashes out randomly, and reaches out with equally random kindness.  That disconnect is a mind-killer: it teaches us that we have no way to influence our world, no way to make it, or our own lives, better.

## Split agency is a perverse incentive.
