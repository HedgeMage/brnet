Recently, I was the subject of a not-very-flattering and not-very-factual article about one of my projects.  I tried to strike a balance between engaging with commenters, making myself available to those who care about the project's future, and staying detached enough to not get sucked in to the personal attacks.  I'm not perfect, but it's something that I feel I've gotten better at over time.

## Well behaved women rarely make history.

I try not to let it bother me.  Part of solving big, messy problems is that there are messy social consequences, and at least some of the problem won't be very visible.  Not everyone will understand, and someone may have been invested in the problem persisting.  Also, when there are real problems in life there are rarely perfect solutions.  Settling for imperfect ones usually makes someone unhappy.

I try to handle it all with some compassion for those who disagree with me--even vocally--and in the end I choose to care about outcomes more than my popularity, and hope for the best.  I consider it part of the price for living an interesting life: the people I know who avoid upsetting anybody tend to do it by not having opinions, not fixing big, hairy problems, and not changing anything that matters.  They do it by conforming, even when the popular or obvious thing is wrong.

##  Guilt by association?

Here's the bit that can get under my skin from time to time.  A large number of people seem to be obsessed with some idea around maintaining ideological purity in projects, endeavors, and organizations.  I've been getting a lot of questions lately along the lines of:

- Why would you allow $person on your project?  They wrote about $subject!
- Why would you accept donations from $source?  Don't you know they $whatever?
- How can you associate with $person? They believe $thing!

I'm so tired of the guilt-by-association/ideological-purity game.  Note that we're not talking about occasions where *my* actions or ethics are being questioned, but where there is an implication that something is wrong with me, or with my work, because of *someone else's* beliefs.

### But they're the *wrong* beliefs!

I don't care.

We look back now on the Spanish Inquisition as an absurdity, but here in the US we're having a new Inquisition right now.  There is tremendous pressure to eschew association with persons bearing unapproved beliefs, to deprive them of their livelihoods, and to do them violence.

* "Punch Nazis" -- where everyone accused of wrongthink is a Nazi
* Calls to fire people who write on the "wrong" subjects or state the "wrong" beliefs.
* Horrible accusations made toward others because they know or have worked with someone accused of wrongthink

### More important is the breakdown in civility.

I was at a professional conference this summer where I met a woman who seemed quite decent.  We got to chatting, and she found out who one of my colleagues is.  "He's a fuckwit!" she said, and proceeded to go on for two full minutes on the subject, while I considered my options and decided this was not the place to point out what a child she was being.  Any respect I had for her as a professional was there dissolved.

It had nothing to do with what I thought of the person being referenced.  This was not a backroom pool hall or a dive bar.  This was not a rough neighborhood, where few have good command of the English language and most of the men have done time.  This was a technical conference with a cost of entry in four figures.

It's incredibly crude to just go around name calling.  It is beneath professionalism.

Had she asked, "Is he hard to work with?", or said "I'm not sure I could work with him," or "You must have the patience of a Saint," her displeasure with that particular person would have been known.  I don't care so much who likes whom, to be honest, and could have gone without hearing it.  We're adults, we can get along simply by being courteous and professional...if we choose to.

However, civility isn't prized by immature minds.  Civility is, at its core, an acknowledgement that there are important things to do in this world, and they are more easily done in an environment not dominated by near-constant petty squabbles.

### Tolerance is not a luxury; it is a necessity.

Note that I didn't say "acceptance".  I often don't want to be friends with this person or that because of their having beliefs incompatible with my own.  I don't turn down collaborating with, or stop being professional around, people for such reasons, however.  Too often, people who claim to be tolerant are [tolerant of everyone but the outgroup](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/)[^1].

However, tolerance is necessary in a society that gets anything done besides constant tribal squabbling and infighting.  We can't go picking fights with everyone who isn't what we wish they were.  As a matter of fact, fate would have it that quite often, disagreeable people also have something good about them.

You'll note that I didn't call that woman who slung ad hominems at my colleague a fuckwit, nor did I name and shame her here.  While I don't *trust* her, I'm also not out to cause a conflict.  What purpose would that serve?  It would merely take time, energy, and attention away from the things I'm getting done.

### Ironies abound.

The Blue Tribe, as Alexander dubs them in his article, referenced above, call themselves the tolerant tribe, yet in today's America they usually are not.  I may not *like* red tribe's values and lifestyle, but at least they aren't trying to eliminate all dissenters.  Blue Tribe is.

Blue Tribe demands that I not work with people who fail to endorse Blue Tribe beliefs.  Imagine if Red Tribe demanded professions of faith before I were to work with someone!  Imagine if they said, "Anyone who's not a conservative Christian should not be allowed to do business."  The country would riot!

However, Blue Tribe demands this over and over today.  You must have a Code of Conduct that meets their standards, or they won't just ignore or boycott your event, they will try to put you out of business.  You must disassociate yourself from loud dissenters, or they will target your career.  It's childish and petty, not to mention insecure (if their beliefs meant anything to them, they would not be threatened by the mere existance of those who disagree).

So, here we have the new Inquisition.

## Meanwhile, back with the adults

Mature professionals...

[^1]: TLDR: You don't get credit for being "tolerant" of those you like or don't mind.  Tolerance is about being decent to those you *dislike and/or disapprove of*, even people *who horrify you*.
