I try not to blog about political things, or succumb too much to the lure of Someone Wrong On the Internet.  But this time, I'm giving in, because it's one of those "standard party lines", the things people keep saying because you *never get fired for buying IBM*.  In other words, it persists only because challenging the narrative is socially risky.  I'm in a position to take the risk.

Young motherhood has often been "linked" with poverty and lack of education.  That is, there is a consistent correlation in the US: wealthy, highly-educated women have babies, on average, much later than poor and working-class women with less formal education.  This *correlation* has deemed by the mathematically illiterate to be *causation*.

A [New York Times article](https://nyti.ms/2Obvf8R) from last month continues this shortsighted narrative, portraying late motherhood as civilized, and early motherhood as just the opposite, based not on evidence, but on correlation of childbearing age with traits that the authors themselves consider important (e.g. obtaining a college degree), and two cherry-picked example stories that support their preconceived notions.

Because the approach seems to be to use individuals' stories to push opinion on the matter, here's a counter-example:

# Why I Chose a Teenage Pregnancy
## College didn't work out for me.

As a young woman from a working-class family who'd been working in some form or another since she was nine, this new adolescence I was asked to embrace at college was stifling and foreign.  My fellow students didn't know how to *do* anything, and everyone thought this was normal.  Most of them were still trying to figure out how to pick a career in their twenties, while I'd worked in seven or eight different industries by the time I hit college at seventeen.

I watched the bills rack up.  Unlike my peers, I'd managed a household before and I knew how scary mounting debt and compound interest could be.  I dealt with medical problems while trying to work and go to school in a town far from my support system, where I didn't have good enough transportation to get a better-paying job than nannying.

The last straw was when a professor supported the research assistant who downgraded my work because I had added unit tests to my code.  He told me that I was writing code that was too complex for PhD students to understand, and that regardless of its effectiveness or efficiency, it wasn't acceptable for class assignments, tests, and projects.  I'd been contributing to open source software, some of it deployed on servers worldwide, for five years at this point.  As my health challenges and debt mounted, I was faced with a professional crisis: I was going to be allowed to have a degree in a profession that I loved only if I downgraded my performance to the point that it would endanger the real-world projects that depended on me. *I would have to become a bad programmer.*

I tried, for a while, mostly due to the fact that my dad finished high school and entered a technical career, having grown up in a community where many kids quit school after 6th grade to work the farm.  I was "the smart one", I was supposed to continue the upward-mobility legacy by going to college like my mother, an elementary school teacher, had, and then use the technical aptitudes I inherited from my father to move up in the world.  In the end, my path lay elsewhere.

## Family Choices

That brief year and a half in college yielded two results that would define my childbearing decisions.  The doctors told me that I may not be able to bear children without surgery, or at all, due to scarring left by a uterine infection I'd suffered while my immune system was impaired by another health crisis.  I also met the man who would become my husband: a guy named Erik, a few years my senior, who'd recently left the U.S. Army after serving in a Ranger unit and was finding his way into the civilian workforce.  He thought a job was a job, he didn't have my career ambitions, so unlike most of the other men I'd dated up to that point, he had no desire for me to set my ambitions aside.

**Then, 9/11 happened.**  At the time, we didn't know whether this would be an isolated incident or the start of something bigger.  Much of the country felt helpless.  Erik made a snap decision to return to active duty, and I supported him.  We decided to marry, largely because the Army wouldn't recognize us as connected enough otherwise, for us to live together, for me to find out if he was killed in action, for me to prevent his problematic extended family from making medical decisions if he were hurt.  We'd started to consider one another family anyway.

Erik reclassed (trained for a different role in the Army) as part of his re-enlistment, because the Ranger unit he would likely have been assigned to garrisoned in Hawaii, somewhere I'd have been incredibly isolated in his absence, with a dearth of job opportunity and visiting my family and friends an expensive pipe dream.  We didn't see one another much for almost a year as he re-trained, but we managed to hold a quick wedding over Presidents' Day weekend while he had some leave.  My parents and godparents made the trip to celebrate with us in Georgia, near Fort Gordon where he was retraining.

The wedding was simple but beautiful.  A local Justice of the Peace married us in his front parlor.  I'd only had four days' notice, but my Mom marched me into a big off-the-rack wedding store in the suburbs, and caused a stink until they sold me a dress without the usual wedding consultant and months of planning.  I just hoped she could afford to pay off the credit card bill for it.  I'm a tomboy and I don't really like dresses, but it was light powder blue and it was perfect.  Shortly after my 19th birthday, I was on my very first airplane ride, and we were married.

My mother's friend, Jane, made me a bouquet of silk flowers--lilacs, like the ones in my grandfather's garden--so that they would survive the trip.  I also found out, back at the little motel where we all stayed, that she'd made a fancy cake topper.  Late the afternoon before, my mom had convinced the local grocery to come up with a simple white two-tiered cake to go under it by morning, so we'd have a proper wedding cake.

It was a crazy time in America, but all of us chose family: the new one that Erik and I were forming, and the one my parents and godparents strengthened by upsetting their lives to help us mark the occasion, despite it being a financial burden for them.

## Starting over

After the wedding, I had to go back and stay with my parents until Erik finished his re-training.  I couldn't find a home or commit to a lease, because I had no idea where the Army would send us when he finished AIT.  In just a couple of months, though, we were apartment hunting in central Texas, having been assigned to Fort Hood.

I didn't know anyone in Texas, and despite my affinity for hot cowboys, farm work, and country music, it was a culture shock.  I also didn't have any of the kind of connections that had helped me find work back in Illinois.  My career was in a reboot, and at 19 I seemed to be the only person who expected that I'd *have* a career, so I ended up rebooting my life a little, too.

We decided not long after my arrival in Texas to start "trying" to get pregnant.  I use the scare quotes because we had no hope it would work; I'd already been told that excessive scarring had blocked my fallopian tubes, leaving me infertile.  However, the Army doctors said that we had to fail to get pregnant for a year before they would evaluate me for surgery.

By my calculations, we conceived in week two.

**The timing couldn't have been better.**  While being so far from family was a bit daunting, I was a fairly independent character.  More importantly: I wasn't disrupting my career.  A cross-country move to a new and different local culture had already been a total disruption.  I was working, but not in my field, so there just wasn't much to disrupt.  I didn't want to upset my career later in life, when I had built something I wanted to protect, nor did I want to be chasing young kids around in middle age.

# My Teen Pregnancy

I keep saying "teenage pregnancy" or variations thereof because I want to wear the stigma off of it by overuse.  *Unprepared* pregnancy is a bad thing: raising a family is no small endeavor, nor is it inexpensive or without skill requirements.  However, in our culture today, a prepared 18 or 19 year old mother is treated with less respect than an unprepared 29 or 30-year-old mother.  At 19, I was married, I had a foothold in a career of my choosing, and a job that, while not entirely my cup of tea, was teaching me new skills and paying me more than my husband made as an E4 in the Army.  I also had the experience of helping to raise, in some way or another, many children as a big sister, cousin, school and counseling center volunteer, babysitter, or nanny.  Juggling kids and other responsibilities was already comfortable and natural for me.

Unfortunately, even in central Texas, the heart of Bible-thumping country, at an Army hospital (generally considered a conservative set), my early prenatal appointments were filled with people who acted as if my child were an unfortunate accident.

> Do you need help telling your parents?

No.  My husband insisted we call them right away.  We're all very happy.

> Have you considered not keeping the baby?

No.  We want to start a family.

> Did you know there are *options* for you this early in a pregnancy?

I know how birth control works, too.  I *want* my baby.

This was followed by countless offers to help me get on welfare; and skeptical responses when I insisted that I did not need or want government assistance.  We weren't wealthy, but we made enough money to care for our child.

Surely, this was some weird backwater conservative reaction, I thought.  I could trust my many professional contacts in the software development world to be more open-minded...or could I?

As it turned out, the wealthy professional women I knew weren't just insensitive as the hospital had been, they were outright cruel.  It was made clear to me, time and time again, that I'd betrayed the group--or perhaps the advancement of women generally--by having a baby so young.  Wait until you are *at least* 35, they insisted, or I was merely showing that I was never serious about having a career in the first place.

I tried to explain my reasons, but in the end I lost all but one of my professional, white-collar female friends over my desire to become a mother.  If it weren't for my Army buddies--the members of a martial arts group I trained with, and a few friends from my husband's unit--I may have lost my mind.  Amusingly, the other social group that stuck with me were a bunch of misfit, largely hard-partying hackers.  I think that both groups saw me as a mother even before I became one; I certainly mothered *them*, sometimes too much, despite being the youngest in both groups.

My family got it.  On the one hand, we have a code of family requiring acceptance as a base value: if you start pushing people away as a means of control, you don't have a family.  On the other hand, both sides of my birth family are fairly traditional Catholic broods, one rural and one suburban, so starting a family young was well within their social and moral vocabulary.  Too bad I'm not Catholic, or I might have found a community in my new environment who understood what I was doing.

## Young Motherhood
I turned twenty just shy of three months before my son's birth.  I had a fairly easy pregnancy, as a young, healthy woman tends to.  Lucas was born healthy, despite an accident at the military hospital when he was born.  My mother came down to Texas to help with the first couple of weeks.  Erik deployed shortly after Lucas turned six weeks old.

With Mom back home, and my husband in theater, I felt very much like a single mother for a little while.  My remaining social circle were some older male Linux nerds, and some male soldiers and contractors who were still in garrison.  I didn't mind too much; I was a tomboy so most of my friends were usually male, but it was strange to be locked out of the company of other mothers.

I was "adopted", for a time, by a club for Jewish mothers on post, despite not sharing their faith.  The religious tensions in the Bible Belt had given them a soft spot for outsiders of all kinds.  I learned to cook Kosher a bit (I'm best trusted with dessert), and finally had other children for Lucas to be around, and other mothers, of a variety of ages, for me to chat and compare experiences with.

By the time my son was just over a year old, my husband had returned from deployment and I'd moved to a software development job that let me work from home most of the time to be with Lucas.  Interestingly, it was in a company where I was the only female technologist that I found this flexibility and understanding.  Women in the industry still branded me as "not serious" when they found out about Lucas, but men seemed to judge me by work and whether I seemed to have my life under control.

## Looking Back
Despite what I've been told, I don't believe that my career has been held back by becoming a mother at a young age, or by not finishing a degree.  Those years were full of doubt and uncertainty on many fronts, but time has shown my decisions to have served my son and I well.

Lucas and I live in Bloomington, Indiana where I work in information security.  Having risen to a leadership position where I manage the security needs of multiple organizations, without a college degree, I don't feel that an early pregnancy hurt my career.  I picked up my first information security officer role 5-10 years younger than most of my college-educated colleagues.

I have had to work through some career challenges due to not having a degree, but I also haven't had college debt to contend with.  I'd paid everything off for my brief stint in college just two or three years after leaving, even though those were the years in which I had a child.  Most of my age-peers who did go to college but did not have parents wealthy enough to pay for it are still paying off college debt in their thirties.  Additionally, they have at least five fewer years in the workforce than I do.

Because I don't have the pressure of supporting huge student loans, I'm able to work for a below-market salary at an institution that gives me incredible work-life balance and flexibility.  I can still afford a beautiful 3-bedroom farmhouse on a few acres at the corner of town, along with my family's odd collection of projects and hobbies.

Lucas is 15 now.  He's doing well in high school, and despite our not having a lot of money when he was younger, he's had some advantages I never dreamed of as a child, such as martial arts lessons, schools without serious violence problems, and summer classes at a local community college.

# I'm Not a Special Case.
I'm going to be a little arrogant here, and claim that I understand social mobility better than most *because I've done it*.  I've been up and down the socio-economic ladder and I've come to understand it.  Unfortunately, most well-meaning commenters who don't have my experience, and haven't bothered to seek out those who do, will say that I am a special case--somehow more noble, talented, or advantaged than everyone else who grew up in situations like mine--and therefor my lessons learned on social mobility are irrelevant.

**I am a special case in only one way:**  I am a deeply driven individual, and a deeply skeptical one. *I never bought into the narrative that I would find a path to social mobility by wholesale imitation of those with higher socio-economic status than myself.*

Think about a map: Someone starts out in Denver, Colorado and needs to get to Chicago, Illinois.  He carefully records his journey: how many miles at what heading to the first turn, then how many miles on what heading to the next.  If someone in Washington, D.C. followed those sound and meticulous directions, she wouldn't get to Chicago, she'd end up in the Atlantic Ocean!

Starting from a high SEC and maintaining it is not the same as starting in a low SEC and moving up.  These are different journeys, over different terrain, which require different tactics.  This is something that people in power fail to acknowledge right now.

# Guideline 1: Less College
Someone from a powerful family who graduates in the bottom 5% of a prestigious law school will still get a reasonably high-paying job doing not-too-challenging legal paperwork somewhere.  They don't have college debt (Mommy and Daddy took care of that).  They have a stable, upper-class future ahead of them, with a possibly uninteresting spouse and maybe some mediocre children.

Someone from a poor family, who went to a mediocre law school, cannot afford to be anything less than the best.  Exuding competence is the only way to overcome that air of "hick" or "ghetto" they haven't learned to cover yet, and make up for seeming underdressed due not not affording expensive enough clothes (or understanding them).  They will leave school with more debt than my house is worth, and with lower grades than their intellect merits, because they worked the whole time in order to eat and, if necessary, support their family.

If that poor kid *isn't* the best at law, he or she is better off skipping law school and getting into the workforce earlier.  A barely-mediocre lawyer with the same economic and social penalties will not live a full life: they will be hounded by debt and probably face extended periods of unemployment when the job market is tight.

**Poor kids should only go to college if there is a clearly positive economic outcome, taking into account debt, interest, years removed from the workforce, health risks, and needing to be twice as good as their wealthy peers in order to overcome SEC stigma.**

Right now, the trades are drastically undermanned, and desperate for smart people.  The guy who pumps my parents' septic tank makes more per hour than my lawyer, and doesn't have a degree.  My brother drives a garbage truck and makes nearly what I do in information security.  If you're passionate about law or infosec, by all means do that.  Just don't be the girl on food stamps with $280k of debt and a womens' studies degree she can't use.

# Guideline 2: Have Kids Young
First pregnancies after about age 30 bring increased health risks to the baby, and after 35 are just plain scary if you can't afford every modern medical trick our world has to offer, and possible long-term care for your child.  For example, [the risk of Down Syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11943789) is about one in 1,441 births for mothers who are 20 years old, but about 1 in 84 births for mothers who are 40[^1].

Additionally, our parents will age faster than wealthy parents: the wealthy have better food, medical care, and generally physically safer jobs.  I go to my hometown and meet women in their 40s who seem much older than my wealthy friends in their 60s.  If we want or need help raising our little ones--and we will, because we can't just hire full-time nannies--we need to do it while our parents are fit, and before we are caring for them as well.

Especially if one has based her career on experience rather than education, one should not take the hit of a mid- or late-career maternity break.  Do it while we are young, as I did, and the disruption is manageable.  As a bonus, if you started work right out of high school rather than doing four or more years of college, you may still be ahead of college-educated peers in experience after two or four maternity leaves.

# Guideline 3: Learn to Tell Your Story
Most people really aren't jerks.  It is easy to believe that every difference between the haves and the have-nots is why the have-nots are in that position, especially when you have no way of really knowing.  Those of us working toward socio-economic mobility, especially those who have achieved some, need to take the social risks involved in turning those perceptions around.  It takes skill to do this effectively, and I am not the best at it, but I'm working on it.

We are set apart when we try to move up because people don't know how to puzzle us out.  From their perspective, we send mixed signals.  I can handle a board better than 90% of the CISOs I know, but it's hard to tell by looking at me.  I never learned how fashion--especially upper-class fashion--really works.  I can wear a suit, but sometimes I do so clumsily, with the wrong blouse or the wrong fit or last decade's style.  I overcome this by being relatable.  My story isn't "poor kid feel sorry for me", it's "tomboy engineer, too busy kicking ass to put on make-up" and it almost always works when I believe it.  I don't need to shove it in anyone's face, either.

# Guideline 4: Build a Support System
Maybe you come from a great family like I do, but if not, build one.  Family-of-choice counts as much as the one you were born into if you do it right.  Be the kind of friend who picks up groceries when someone is ill, or pitches in on a bad day, because you'll need those.  I'm learning now just how many problems can be fixed with money.  I was ill on a business trip recently and I ordered *room service* because I couldn't stand to leave my hotel room.  It turns out that money can make strangers bring you bland chicken and soup in bed.  Who knew I'd ever live that way.

It's a lot cheaper, and more friendly, though if you're sick at home and you call your mom, or your best friend, or your spouse and they bring you a meal.
