It's that time of year again... getting ready for **National Novel Writing Month**, or [NaNaWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org). I agreed with my son to do it this November, with one concession: I will be sacriligiously working on nonfiction.  My November will be spent hastily hacking away on a draft for an as-yet-unannounced infosec/software book.

I'm traveling a bit this month, which adds to the challenge, but I have supportive friends and loved ones (not to mention a kickass editor!).
