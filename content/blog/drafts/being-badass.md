It's been one of those weeks.  When I find myself talking about self defense with those who lack real experience having to do it, I spend a lot of time rolling my eyes...not because I think that someone who's only seen violence on TV is likely to understand it, but because of this idea of an "other" that so permeates the common view of violence in our society.  That idea is why I hear things like:

> "Why do you train so hard? It's not like someone like you needs help kicking ass."  
  
> "You should never try to [protect a loved one who's been grabbed by a violent criminal], you can only make it worse.  Leave it to the professionals."  

> "There's no way that really happened to you.  You're just a regular person, not some kind of hardass."  

> "I can't believe you lived through that -- you must be a total badass."

> "Stop talking like you expect martial arts to have anything to do with a real conflict with a real criminal -- you aren't some kind of badass."

Whether they think I'm one or not, each of these people (and many more I've spoken to over the years) espouse the idea that "people capable of dealing with violence" are a special class somehow identifiably different than the rest of humanity.  For some, the difference is authority: uniforms and badges make one one of the "special" people.  For others, it's training (at least this makes some sense).  For still others, it's an innate quality -- almost a lack of purity -- that sets the "special" people from those who are helpless.

I'm what my maternal grandmother would call an "odd duck"...a nerdy, overweight single mom who spends 4-5 days a week sweating it out on the mats in my neighborhood dojo, learning to punch and kick, lock joints, throw, choke, fall, and more.  Then I put my little one to bed at night, set out a mosquito repellant burner in the front yard, and do it some more while he sleeps.  If my behavior must be labelled, I kind of like "odd duck".  It's a lot more me than "badass".

A recent exchange in the Comments on [one of esr's blog posts](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4494) included the question of what one would do if one had the chance to escape armed robbers during a home invasion while those robbers had one's loved one at gun/knife point.  I won't delve into details, you can read the exchange if you would like, but the gist of it is that Eric and I both stated that we would engage the assailants if at all possible rather than retreat and call the cops.  One commenter mistook our [understanding of the grim realities of such a situation](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4494&cpage=1#comment-386366) for overconfidence.  This dovetails with a conversation I found myself having at the dojo this morning.

In talking to Sensei, it came up that a friend of mine has a bad case of "yellow-belt syndrome": what we martial artists call it when someone gets his first rank or three and decides that he is an indomitable badass.  The arrogance is easy to fall into, and detrimental to both training and personal safety.  As an extra-special mode of fail, this particular YBS sufferer decided to project: he had actually asked why I train so hard when I am "already totally capable of kicking ass".

## A dose of reality:

I'm a 5'7", overweight, not very muscular soccer mom.  In the unlikely event that I am attacked by someone, it is almost certain that my attacker will be taller, fitter, and stronger than I.  There's a not-insignificant chance that the attacker would be a more experienced fighter, too.  I've managed to come out the other side of some Bad Things in my life, but not by outmatching anyone.  If anything, my main advantage has been that very few people expect that squishy mommy type (or the bubbly teenager I used to be) to do anything but freeze or comply.

There are some things I have right: I seem to lack a freeze instinct, my "go buttons" are firmly in place, I have no illusions of there being rules in a life-or-death encounter, and no ideas about stopping unless I am completely incapacitated, or the threat is no longer a threat.  However, until recently, [my training was pretty scattershot](/2010/06/01/mile-wide-half-inch-deep/), and it shows.  I've been at my current dojo for a couple of years, but it's only in the last year that I've been able to put in time and focus with reasonable regularity.

## Whence comes the unreality?

It's not the first time I've been accused of being a badass (real or wanna-be), and I'm willing to bet not the first time for Eric, either.  Other sheepdog personalities I know report similar interactions.  We're all people, but outside our own closest social circles, not everyone who sees us being sheepdogs sees it that way.  The most common myths we see are:

 * Badasses are inhuman.
 * Badasses may be human, but they are damaged humans who don't have close relationships.
 * Badasses may be human, but they look different than other humans.
 * Badasses don't value their own lives.
 * Badasses are one-dimensional; they can't also be other things.

It's inescapable in the way that hero badass archetypes are portrayed in books and film.

* Superman is an alien.
* The X-men are mostly mutants.
* Wolverine and Captain America are the result of supersoldier experiments.
* Spiderman was bitten by a radioactive spider.
* Your typical action hero is a burnt-out soldier who's lost everyone he's loved.  He's deeply damaged and alone.

Some people think the problem is the media, or so I've been told.  However, I think that's a symptom of living in a culture where the vast majority of people will never learn the skills for combating life-and-limb-threatening violence.  All in all this is a good thing: dealing with human violence in an effective and ethical way is a deep and broad skill set.  Developing, maintaining, and practicing it takes time and energy that most people now get to devote to other pursuits.  The down side of this is that, as dealing with violence becomes uncommon enough that most people no longer build and maintain the skill set, the skill sets for dealing with violence become foreign and themselves scary.  If you aren't proficient, and aren't close to anyone who is...it's easy to start *othering* those who have the skill set.  From a sufficient distance, it may honestly look no different from the skills of a predator.  In fact, there is overlap there...in skills, but not in ethics or motivation.

## Why care?

This narrative of "regular people" and "badasses" is pretty warped, and has a number of negative effects:

* It creates a social disincentive to preparing for Bad Things.  People, on the whole, won't do things they can't talk about, and seeming too into martial arts, or disaster prep, or whatever is likely to get one labeled

* It isolates people who have come out the other side of Bad Things mostly intact.  Soldiers, protectors, rescuers learn to be very careful not to talk about certain things around those not like them due to the social fallout.  When someone who isn't in a role that connects them with such a community, they often become extremely isolated after the event and are more prone to lasting stress and general fallout.  People 

* It makes people think they can't step up.  I've lost count of how many times in a disaster area I am stunned by the difference of a cluster of people where one just decided to do their best, and where everyone decided to wait for the authorities.  The difference in injuries, morale, and general safety is stark.
