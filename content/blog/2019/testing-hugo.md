Tonight, I began playing with Hugo, a static site generator in Go.  I've been a
big fan of static site generators for some time, due to the incredible freedom
of just not maintaining a CMS before, especially for simple content.  I've long
needed to move from Ghost, which is great for its target audience, but too
WYSIWYG and clicky for my engineer brain.

So far, so good.  Hugo is much faster to compile and has a much bigger and more
varied theme ecosystem than Nikola, the static site generator I'd worked with
previously.  I'm still putting my new deployment workflow through its paces with
the intention of getting myself set up to post not just from a real computer but
from my tablet as well.

Wish me luck!
