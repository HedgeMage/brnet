# Stabproof Coffee Recipe
A hot, low-carb mocha (chocolate & coffee) flavored protein shake named for an office joke from years ago.

I use Isopure Dutch Chocolate Low Carb protein powder: https://amzn.to/2VrTmWr

Half-and-half, whole milk, or almond milk can be substituted for the heavy cream in this recipe in descending order of calories and feeling of fullness.  Experiment!

## Ingredients:

* **Heavy Cream**
  4 tablespoons (1/4 cup, or about 45-58g depending on hydration)

* **Protein Powder (see above)**
  1 scoop (33g)

* **Coffee**
  Black American Coffee: about 10 fl. oz. *or*
  Espresso: 1 shot, plus enough hot water to make up the rest of your mug or bottle's volume

* **Whipped Cream**
  To taste, if you're feeling fancy today.

*N.B. It's important that the protein powder and coffee don't spend time together before the cream base soaks in, or else you'll get disgusting cooked-acidified-whey-powder-lumps.  So, here are different directions for mug prep vs. in a shaker bottle.*

## Directions - Mug:

1. Start coffee/water heating.
2. Put cream in bottom of mug, followed by protein powder.  Stir until thoroughly blended (there shouldn't be any dry lumps of protein powder left).
3. Add your shot of espresso or first couple ounces of drip coffee and blend thoroughly until no or very few, small lumps remain.  Don't forget to scrape the sides of the mug as you go.
4. Add remainder of drip coffee or hot water (if you started with espresso), stir to incorporate.
5. Top with whipped cream, if desired.

Approx 259 kcal, 3g carbs (2g net carbs), 17g fat, 25g protein in default recipe with heavy cream and no whipped cream topping.

## Directions - Shaker Bottle

1. Start coffee/water heating.
2. Place protein powder in bottom of shaker bottle, and layer heavy cream on top.
3. Add either your drip coffee, or a shot of espresso plus hot water, on top of the existing ingredients.
4. Close bottle tightly and shake vigorously: the faster you blend the ingredients after beginning to add coffee, the fewer lumps you will have.
5. Top with whipped cream, if desired.

These keep me very full, but I also realize that I eat less than most people.  You can double the protein and cream pretty easily if you prefer.  Or, ask me about the giant iced chocolate shakes I did when I was weightlifting. :)
