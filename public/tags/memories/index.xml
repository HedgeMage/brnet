      <description>One of my mentees recently left me with a very special gift: a copy of Donald Knuth&amp;rsquo;s The Art of Computer Programming, Vols 1-4a.
Besides being a staple of the computer science community, these books have a special meaning for me personally. They remind me of another, even more priceless, gift: the support of adults in my young life, especially my parents, even when they didn&amp;rsquo;t understand me. I grew up in the last place one might expect a software engineer or information security professional to come from: the remains of an old farming community on Chicago&amp;rsquo;s south side, surrounded by some rougher neighborhoods.</description>
