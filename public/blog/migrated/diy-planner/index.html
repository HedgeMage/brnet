    <p>I&rsquo;ve finally given up on keeping my calendar, etc. on the laptop. It just doesn&rsquo;t work for me. I&rsquo;ve gone back to the system that got me through my youth juggling homework, work, extracurricular activities, volunteer commitments, family events, and some minor political activism &ndash; an 8&rdquo; by 5.5&rdquo; paper planner.</p>
<p>I caught a sale at Office Max, and picked up a leather planner binder with some undated starter pages and a year&rsquo;s worth of dated refill pages, for about $15 more than I&rsquo;d have expected to pay for just just the year of dated pages. Not bad, since the binder could have retailed for more than I paid for the entire shopping trip. That, of course, is one of my biggest reasons for trying to leave my paper day planner habits behind: they get expensive. I was lucky to have found a good bargain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very particular about my planner, and as luck would have it, the pages I like the best are among the most expensive on the planet: Day-Timer. The possibility of making my own pages has lingered for some time on a shelf somewhere in the back of my mind. However, the time required to come up with a layout I am happy with would likely be considerable, so the idea has remained shelved, until now&hellip; Enter <a href="http://www.diyplanner.com">DIY Planner</a>, a great (Drupal-powered!) site offering organizational tips, and free templates for creating everything from the ubiquitous 8&quot;x5.5&rdquo; ring-bound planner to the super-light &ldquo;Hipster PDA&rdquo;, an organizational system designed to be printed on index cards and bound with a binder clip for maximum portability. With a computer, printer, and some basic office supplies (plus a binder, if you like that sort of thing), it is quite easy to create a fairly customized planner system for a fraction of the price of commercial ones, thanks to the DIY Planner templates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m well stocked with Day-Timer dated pages through the end of 2007, however I plan to give DIY addon pages a try right away.</p>
