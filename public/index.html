            Tonight, I began playing with Hugo, a static site generator in Go. I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of static site generators for some time, due to the incredible freedom of just not maintaining a CMS before, especially for simple content. I&rsquo;ve long needed to move from Ghost, which is great for its target audience, but too WYSIWYG and clicky for my engineer brain.
So far, so good. Hugo is much faster to compile and has a much bigger and more varied theme ecosystem than Nikola, the static site generator I&rsquo;d worked with previously.

            One of my mentees recently left me with a very special gift: a copy of Donald Knuth&rsquo;s The Art of Computer Programming, Vols 1-4a.
Besides being a staple of the computer science community, these books have a special meaning for me personally. They remind me of another, even more priceless, gift: the support of adults in my young life, especially my parents, even when they didn&rsquo;t understand me. I grew up in the last place one might expect a software engineer or information security professional to come from: the remains of an old farming community on Chicago&rsquo;s south side, surrounded by some rougher neighborhoods.

            This page serves as a living index of things a hacker could use to raise their effectiveness in the general sense. These are the bits of professional development that are often glossed over or skipped in the learning paths of technical people. I often refer my mentees to these resources, and have most of the books in my personal library available for loan to friends, colleagues, and Newguardians.
Time Management and General Organization Resources in this section are focused on at least one of the three pillars of general productivity: finding more time in which to do work, fitting more work into the same amount of time, or doing more impactful work.
